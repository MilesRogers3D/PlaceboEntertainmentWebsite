# MAY 31ST, 2024 - Missed Deadlines
So remember when Rachel said we formed cross functional teams for this project? Say, two weeks ago? Well, they have certainly given us some valuable insight on the early stages of production… and by that, I mean we have moved back our first milestone deadline, and temporarily disbanded our functional teams.

Before I fully open that can of worms: hi! I’m Caden Sheahan, Co-Producer of Placebo Entertainment alongside Rachel. I’ve been given the pleasure of outlining what we’ve learned from pushing back our deadline, and the decisions we made at the production level to ensure we can reach the new milestone we set. (June 14th!)

The decision for functional teams was originally made by Rachel and I because we wanted our teams to work directly alongside other disciplines. As Rachel stated before, this was a new opportunity for our team members that classes have never truly given them before. So we were excited by the opportunity we had to allow our team to learn from and work with creatives that were different from their area of expertise. Not only that, we also built teams that we felt complimented the strengths of their individual members quite well. We puzzled out the goals of each team member, and with those in mind, created teams with unique strengths stemming from their individual members.

“Wow Caden, those sound like great teams that meet the practical and ideal needs of the project you’re working on! So… what went wrong?” Well, dear reader, as much as these teams met the individual goals of their members, and the company level goals of production, the most important agent in that ecosystem was overlooked: the game itself.

We’ve been working on our First Playable Milestone up to this point. That means we’re building the functionality of the game at the prototype level, first and foremost. And that means that the work we are doing for the game is very foundational. We’re building the systems that the rest of the game will be held up by, and most importantly, that need to communicate with each other. Additionally, the artistic identity of the project is largely being defined through conceptual work. Our artists have done a great job of that so far, but… conceptual artwork doesn’t really get made to be implemented in-engine.

Now, what sounds better? Functional teams, cross disciplinary teams that are working on different foundational systems for the entire game, that don’t require in-depth artwork. Or our good ole’ fashioned discipline teams, where the programmers, designers, and artists can all work together to build the foundations of the rest of the project from their respective fields of expertise?

The second option sounded much better to Rachel and I, so for the remainder of our First Playable Milestone, we ran with our classic discipline teams. Now, it was only after this that we learned from one of our company mentors that most game companies actually run with discipline teams for these earlier stages of production themselves. So… hooray for us! We learned the hard way how most game companies do things in industry! And to me, that’s a victory.
