               "body" : "Placebo Entertainment has officially kicked off, but before I talk about what we are working on, I want to talk about how we got here.\n\nOur team is made up of 18 incredible artists, designers, and programmers, all of whom are currently students at Bradley University. There were a multitude of factors that led to a bunch of college kids thinking starting their own company was a good idea. For one, half of us were already paying rent for our campus apartments over the summer and decided to stay in town. So we needed something to do. I also have been interested in indie development since way before starting college. Unfortunately, it is usually pretty hard to get an internship at a smaller studio. Being an overly ambitious aspiring producer, the solution was obvious: make my own internship - make my own studio. But I couldn’t do it on my own. I immediately reached out to Miles Rogers, one of the most capable artists I knew, and pitched him my idea. In his defense he didn’t immediately call me crazy. In fact, he was in almost immediately. And thus what would become Placebo Entertainment began.\n\nRegardless of how many different areas Miles is unfairly proficient at, we knew we couldn’t do it on our own. Our first step would need to be creating our team. Luckily, we knew a great group of passionate people, all of whom were excited to spend their summer vacation refining their skills and growing in their disciplines. Almost everyone was planning on working full time - some at industry related jobs, some not - but everyone was ready to jump in and sign their evenings away to work on one more project. I’ll skip over the boring company set up stuff, (the most exciting part was picking the name so you’ve already got the highlights) taking us back to the start of the project!\n\nAs a creative person there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a bunch of the most capable and creative people you know in one room and just doing what they do best. Within hours we had our concept - which we will be sharing here soon - people had flowcharts, initial characters drawn up, and my personal favorite: lots of documentation. It is admittedly ambitious to try to complete a game in a summer, but if anyone could do it, it would be this team. I should know, I picked them!\n\nWe will be updating this blog weekly to track our production, and share our successes and failures as we try out this indie game dev thing. Stay tuned and get in contact; we’ve got almost three months to go!",
