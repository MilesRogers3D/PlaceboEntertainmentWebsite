               "body": "Placebo Entertainment has officially kicked off, but before I talk about what we are working on, I want to talk about how we got here.\n\nOur team is made up of 18 incredible artists, designers, and programmers, all of whom are currently students at Bradley University. There were a multitude of factors that led to a bunch of college kids thinking starting their own company was a good idea. For one, half of us were already paying rent for our campus apartments over the summer and decided to stay in town. So we needed something to do. I also have been interested in indie development since way before starting college. Unfortunately, it is usually pretty hard to get an internship at a smaller studio. Being an overly ambitious aspiring producer, the solution was obvious: make my own internship - make my own studio. But I couldn’t do it on my own. I immediately reached out to Miles Rogers, one of the most capable artists I knew, and pitched him my idea. In his defense he didn’t immediately call me crazy. In fact, he was in almost immediately. And thus what would become Placebo Entertainment began.\n\nRegardless of how many different areas Miles is unfairly proficient at, we knew we couldn’t do it on our own. Our first step would need to be creating our team. Luckily, we knew a great group of passionate people, all of whom were excited to spend their summer vacation refining their skills and growing in their disciplines. Almost everyone was planning on working full time - some at industry related jobs, some not - but everyone was ready to jump in and sign their evenings away to work on one more project. I’ll skip over the boring company set up stuff, (the most exciting part was picking the name so you’ve already got the highlights) taking us back to the start of the project!\n\nAs a creative person there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a bunch of the most capable and creative people you know in one room and just doing what they do best. Within hours we had our concept - which we will be sharing here soon - people had flowcharts, initial characters drawn up, and my personal favorite: lots of documentation. It is admittedly ambitious to try to complete a game in a summer, but if anyone could do it, it would be this team. I should know, I picked them!\n\nWe will be updating this blog weekly to track our production, and share our successes and failures as we try out this indie game dev thing. Stay tuned and get in contact; we’ve got almost three months to go!",

               "body": "Nothing like finding out that your LLC paperwork went through like getting a letter letting you know you need to do your taxes. To be honest I have never been so excited to get tax information. For this project I (Rachel Rudy) will be taking on most of the business aspects of the company. This involves contract writing and managing our budget, two things I’ve really never done before. It’s certainly daunting, but I will admit it has been super fun to try to figure all of this stuff out.\n\n In more important game news we have begun getting our hands in-engine. My partner in production Caden and I have gone through the hard work of setting up cross discipline teams. This is the first time we’ve ever done this so seriously for a project, most of our teams are at least five people smaller than the 18 we have now, and so we usually kept to discipline teams, or paired designers with programmers. That’s another thing that’s unique about this project, we are working with a lot of artists! Game Art is a different track at our school, and it’s still relatively new, so it’s still being integrated into the Game Design track. Aside from projects for our end of the year showcase, this is the first time we’ve managed a team with more than one game artist. It has been super fun to watch their progress up close, and I hope to learn a lot more about the game art pipeline during this project.\n\n We will hopefully have some of our other contributors talking on here soon, but in the meantime let me talk to you about what we’re making! \n\nOur current concept is: You’re aboard a spacecraft minutes from destruction. While trying to help crewmates and prevent smaller disasters, the ship will be destroyed. Luckily you’re stuck in a time loop, so you can save the ship. Unfortunately you’re stuck in a time loop, so you have to save the captain and steer the ship out of a black hole all within a short amount of time. We’re taking influence from \"The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”  by Douglas Adams, and \"A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet” by Becky Chambers to build interesting alien characters and cultures to populate a first-person trial-and-error exploration puzzle game, all to be completed by August.\n\n I know, it’s a little ambitious, but that’s what a summer project is for, right? Well either way, we’re excited to show you our progress as we get to our first playable date, fastly approaching on the 31st! See you then.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-Rachel",

               "body": "Hey everyone this week we want to feature our art team, so here’s them talking about the work they’ve been doing so far!\n\n\"To me, concept art is my chance to be a designer instead of an artist. Yes, the actual designers give me the prompt that I have to follow, but in the end, I’m still the creative making the characters come to life through visuals. My favorite part of the process is definitely the first step because that’s where I get to run wild and really test the limits of how far I can go while still having the criteria needed for the character. Sometimes those insane ideas that I just so happened to put together get to make it to round 2. It’s a whole other level of \"woah! I made that!” because it will not only be my 3D model but also my IDEA.” \n- Jasper\n\n\"I\"m a VFX artist at Placebo Entertainment, and I'm also making character concept art. Thing is, I didn't study to be an artist; my VFX skills are self-taught and concept art is very new to me. It's been quite a unique and fun -and a little stressful- experience working on concept art alongside actual game art students. This project has been a good chance to work with new people, learn new skills, and most importantly, enjoy doing it!” \n- Caelie\n\n\"For the environment art, we wanted to step a bit outside of the beaten sci-fi path, going for a friendly and inviting tone, as opposed to the typical cold and clinical spaces one might expect. We’ve primarily taken inspiration from retrofuturism, mid-century modern architecture, and Soviet industrial design, borrowing their warmer color palettes and unusual yet stylish shape language.\n\tFor the character art, we decided to emulate the style of stop-motion Claymation, focusing primarily on creative shape language and design. While the environments are meant to feel cozy and familiar, the characters will feel the opposite. We will attempt to match many of the quirks and uncanny characteristics of the medium, utilizing a custom-built shader that mimics things like shifting fingerprints and form inconsistencies between frames.” \n- Miles\n\n\"One of the most intimidating things for me to create as a character artist is concept art. It's one of those skills I enjoy but struggle with. One thing that helps me immensely is character briefs. These helped me so much to guide me in a direction where I want to go and not have one million ideas floating in my head. Character briefs typically include descriptions from designers outlining the initial vision for a character, focusing on functionality and a rough narrative. I was in charge of designing the \"Angel\" and player character.\n\nDesigning the Angel\nBrief: Comes from a planet completely bountiful in resources, however, recently has suffered constant attack from raiders and bandits, and has turned the commonly open minded and friendly people cold and skeptical of outsiders.\n\nThe angel started with another artist Jasper on the first iterations then handed off to me! After reviewing feedback, I decided to refine two of the strongest designs, each with a distinct appearance. One design took on a more alien aesthetic, while the other depicted a commanding, powerful humanoid figure. This whole process was very split on which way to take the character but ultimately, I chose the humanoid design to balance our already diverse array of animalistic characters.\n \nDesigning the Player Character\nBrief: A human from Earth. Passed the space exploration exam with flying colors and has been given a rare opportunity to start their career as second in command on the ship. First week on the job. Motivated, bright eyed.\n\nFor the player character, I began with loose sketches to determine the character's silhouette and gather initial feedback. The team decided to exclude the face and opted for a more generic work outfit. I first did very loose sketches to find out the silhouette of the character and get feedback, our team decided to exclude the face and have a more generic work outfit. Our design team has been a great help on what works with the narrative they want to tell and how to work it into our character designs. I iterated more and got a final helmet and outfit design. I had to work around the main colors of the other alien designs that were finished and we had the final design!\"\n - Amanda\n",

               "body" : "So remember when Rachel said we formed cross functional teams for this project? Say, two weeks ago? Well, they have certainly given us some valuable insight on the early stages of production… and by that, I mean we have moved back our first milestone deadline, and temporarily disbanded our functional teams.\n\nBefore I fully open that can of worms: hi! I’m Caden Sheahan, Co-Producer of Placebo Entertainment alongside Rachel. I’ve been given the pleasure of outlining what we’ve learned from pushing back our deadline, and the decisions we made at the production level to ensure we can reach the new milestone we set. (June 14th!)\n\nThe decision for functional teams was originally made by Rachel and I because we wanted our teams to work directly alongside other disciplines. As Rachel stated before, this was a new opportunity for our team members that classes have never truly given them before. So we were excited by the opportunity we had to allow our team to learn from and work with creatives that were different from their area of expertise. Not only that, we also built teams that we felt complimented the strengths of their individual members quite well. We puzzled out the goals of each team member, and with those in mind, created teams with unique strengths stemming from their individual members.\n\n“Wow Caden, those sound like great teams that meet the practical and ideal needs of the project you’re working on! So… what went wrong?” Well, dear reader, as much as these teams met the individual goals of their members, and the company level goals of production, the most important agent in that ecosystem was overlooked: the game itself.\n\nWe’ve been working on our First Playable Milestone up to this point. That means we’re building the functionality of the game at the prototype level, first and foremost. And that means that the work we are doing for the game is very foundational. We’re building the systems that the rest of the game will be held up by, and most importantly, that need to communicate with each other. Additionally, the artistic identity of the project is largely being defined through conceptual work. Our artists have done a great job of that so far, but… conceptual artwork doesn’t really get made to be implemented in-engine.\n\nNow, what sounds better? Functional teams, cross disciplinary teams that are working on different foundational systems for the entire game, that don’t require in-depth artwork. Or our good ole’ fashioned discipline teams, where the programmers, designers, and artists can all work together to build the foundations of the rest of the project from their respective fields of expertise?\n\nThe second option sounded much better to Rachel and I, so for the remainder of our First Playable Milestone, we ran with our classic discipline teams. Now, it was only after this that we learned from one of our company mentors that most game companies actually run with discipline teams for these earlier stages of production themselves. So… hooray for us! We learned the hard way how most game companies do things in industry! And to me, that’s a victory.\n\n- Caden",
